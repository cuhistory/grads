The ambassadors of the 1920's and 1930's displayed a general continuity of interpretationand advice, expressing consistent support for a policy of appeasing German desires. These diplomats saw German society as unstable and given to outbreaks of extremism, but in the long run amenable to conciliatory treatment, since the governing elite was predominantly moderate and responsable. This moderate element was,in the eyes of the ambassadors, trustworthy and could be strengthened by timely British gestures and concessions. The advent of Hitler altered the picture only in that the threat of extremist elements became more immediate. Nazi ambitions were increasingly seen as legitimate, as one ambassedor succeeded another, and Hitler was portrayed as a moderate within the Third Reich. This coincided with a continuing decline in the ambassadors' relations with German leaders and officials and in the quality of their sources of information. Nevertheless, the British representatives also described the risks of an appeasement policy and the need for caution and the development of British strength while executing this policy. On the whole, the despatches of the ambassadors suggest that any divergence of views between them and the British government has been exaggerated.

The origins of the risings at Bury St. Edmunds and St. Albans are considered and their relationship to the political crisis are analysed. Chapter II considers the response of Isabella and Mortimer to political dissension within the realm and the threat of invasion from Scotland. The impact of the policy of accommodation upon the local risings is discussed. Chapter III looks at the involvement of the central authority in preparing for war and in conducting the northern campaigns between April and October 1327. The origins and events of the Abingdon rising are studied. Governmental reaction to renewed violence at Bury is examined. Chapter IV studies the functioning of the judicial process at Bury from October 1527 till May 1328. The efforts of the central government to secure convictions against the accused and the attendant response of the local inhabitants are discussed. Chapter V provides a quantitative analysis of the social and economic status of the Bury rebels based upon a comparative study of the record of the oyer et terminer proceedings and the Suffolk subsidy roll for 1327.

Indeed before the colony was a decade old there were nearly a score of identifiable schools established, some with more longevity than others.  These schools were varied: some were run by ministers of the Church of England, by loyalists, by Presbyterians, by Baptists, by Moravians and by men who had failed at other employment, and by 1804 the Catholics were demanding their own. There was a classical school, a school for Mohawks and a school for orphans. These schools, however varied, strove for a basic goal. It was their intent to promote loyalty, morality and Christianity in the colony. This striving for morality was in the old Puritan sense. They were not to give the people charity, alms, but to promote man himself. The man was to be made aware of his usefulness and this would prevent sloth and excess.
