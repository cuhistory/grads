The ambassadors of the 1920's and 1930's displayed a general continuity of interpretationand advice, expressing consistent support for a policy of appeasing German desires. These diplomats saw German society as unstable and given to outbreaks of extremism, but in the long run amenable to conciliatory treatment, since the governing elite was predominantly moderate and responsable. This moderate element was,in the eyes of the ambassadors, trustworthy and could be strengthened by timely British gestures and concessions. The advent of Hitler altered the picture only in that the threat of extremist elements became more immediate. Nazi ambitions were increasingly seen as legitimate, as one ambassedor succeeded another, and Hitler was portrayed as a moderate within the Third Reich. This coincided with a continuing decline in the ambassadors' relations with German leaders and officials and in the quality of their sources of information. Nevertheless, the British representatives also described the risks of an appeasement policy and the need for caution and the development of British strength while executing this policy. On the whole, the despatches of the ambassadors suggest that any divergence of views between them and the British government has been exaggerated.

The origins of the risings at Bury St. Edmunds and St. Albans are considered and their relationship to the political crisis are analysed. Chapter II considers the response of Isabella and Mortimer to political dissension within the realm and the threat of invasion from Scotland. The impact of the policy of accommodation upon the local risings is discussed. Chapter III looks at the involvement of the central authority in preparing for war and in conducting the northern campaigns between April and October 1327. The origins and events of the Abingdon rising are studied. Governmental reaction to renewed violence at Bury is examined. Chapter IV studies the functioning of the judicial process at Bury from October 1527 till May 1328. The efforts of the central government to secure convictions against the accused and the attendant response of the local inhabitants are discussed. Chapter V provides a quantitative analysis of the social and economic status of the Bury rebels based upon a comparative study of the record of the oyer et terminer proceedings and the Suffolk subsidy roll for 1327.

Indeed before the colony was a decade old there were nearly a score of identifiable schools established, some with more longevity than others.  These schools were varied: some were run by ministers of the Church of England, by loyalists, by Presbyterians, by Baptists, by Moravians and by men who had failed at other employment, and by 1804 the Catholics were demanding their own. There was a classical school, a school for Mohawks and a school for orphans. These schools, however varied, strove for a basic goal. It was their intent to promote loyalty, morality and Christianity in the colony. This striving for morality was in the old Puritan sense. They were not to give the people charity, alms, but to promote man himself. The man was to be made aware of his usefulness and this would prevent sloth and excess.

This thesis argues that between 1888 and 1937, a dominant social ethic gainedwidespread acceptance in the academic community, and that until World War II, it provided a framework for the University's official participation in social service.By examining the social thought of a series ofinfluential academics, the study traces the dissemination atthe University of Toronto of an identifiable ethic or ideal: a combination of scientific and moral assumptions which originated in the distinct--but compatible--intellectualtraditions of empiricism and Fritish idealism. These convictions shaped the University's formal responses to thepoverty crisis after 1900, and were incorporated into thepolicy of the University of Toronto Settlement im 1910, andinto the curriculum of the new Department of Social Servicein 1914.Although this interpretation of social service remaineddominant at Toronto until the late 1930s, its authority was contested by the growing influence of professional social work among University women. The Toronto ideal conveyed aview of service which elevated the importance of educated men, while it devalued and ignored the social workactivities of female students and graduates.

Most Council women in the 1890s believed that a sexual division of labour rooted in women's peculiar responstibility for mothering and homemaking engendered an authoritative female moral voice. Their construction of female authority was grounded in a non-hierarchical understanding of gender relations in which women's institutions and social responsibilities were merely different from, not subordinate to, those of men. As such, they believed that a middle-class women's “parliament"" like the NCWC would enable them to transform their traditional religious responsibility for the welfare of poor women and children into a national obligation to protect, relieve, and rescue the female half of humanity. Council women were initially able to convince legislators that the NCWC represented and spoke for the women of Canada but, as the decade progressed, they found that the NCWC had no real power to effect social reforms that challenged institutionalized male prerogative or authority. This was most forcefully underscored by the NCWC's attempts to found the Victorian Order of Nurses for Canada.

However, this decision was ultimately abandoned by the government in exchange for a joint seaway plan.

This study examines the experience of the ordinary residents of Dawson City during the gold rush period. It looks in some detail at four components of the new community: Native people, miners and other labourers, prostitutes and other professionals of the demi-monde, as well as the professional and business sectors. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative sources, the portrait of Dawson that emerges here is quite different from that of the popular literature. The Native community was disrupted by the stampede and its development continued separately from Dawson's. Far from being a ""community of men,"" a surprising number o€ families were present and Klondikers as a whole show a surprising rate of persistence.

Based largely on origiral research done in the former Soviet Union, this study attempts to disprove the claims of some historians that the cult of Lenin was of minor importance for most of the twentietl century. In this thesis, it is argued that the Lenin cult served a vital political and social function in Soviet society until the final collapse of the USSR. The importance of the Lenin cult is illustrated by focusing on the manner in which Lenin’s heirs manipulated the cult, the role of the media in propagating Lenin’s cult myths, and the aggressive indoctrination of primary school children with the cult. The eventual collapse of the cult is shown to be inextricably linked to the decline of the Soviet state in the Gorbachev era.

Recent interest in the importance of visualization in scientific literature demands a reappraisal of the value of images. Images can be examined from a number of perspectives, including that of material history which seeks not oniy to understand the specific content of the image but also its context. Michzl Foucault has suggested that images can be analyzed as discourse particularly in relation to his igegas concerning the archaeology of knowledge, which privileges persistence as much as change. The thesis examines a particular set of images related to Canada from the sixteenth to the early nineteenth centuries. These images are of the sort traditionally identified as ""scientific illustration,"" and include images from early maps and books, as well as representations of flora and fauna from the seventeenth and eiﬁhteenth centuries, and illustrations to exf?edition accounts from the nineteenth century. The way in which images define the experience of the New World for Europeans is discussed. Of particular interest as well is the use which scientists and scholars have made of images for communication and for the visualization of complex data. Prior to the advent of colour printing in the mid-nineteenth century, many scholars relied upon mnuscrigfoor hand-coloured printed images for information. This practice is documented from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries. The notion of accuracY is examined in looking at images painted ""from life.""

While various aspects of the idea of North have been delineated in both popular and scholarly discourse, the following study seeks to illuminate the visual aspects of northem imagery, through an analysis of the photographic and filmic practice of ""the Crown, the Company, and the Church,” the three major southern institutions involved in the arctic and sub-arctic. In the first half of the twentieth century, as the north was further incorporated into the Canadian nation, visual representations of the region were widely circulated in official publications and presented in film shows and lantemn slide lectures. It is argued that photographic ways of seeing performed a vital and active part in the federal government’s attempts to assert a measure of control over its northern territories. In particular, the representational strategies of the Northwest Territories and Yukon Branch are investigated. At the same time, the Anglican Church of Canada was engaged in the visual construction of the region; as pictured by Archibald Lang Fleming, first Bishop of the Arctic, the North was in a Twilight stage, poised on the movement from primitive paganism to Christian civiiization. The Hudson’s Bay Company, as the major corporate power in the region, also contributed to the growing archive of northern images, in the process presenting itself as a responsibie, imperially-minded and benevolent agent of northern development.

The urban and rural areas of Port Arthur and Fort William, which experienced rapid population growth and changes in ethnic composition mainly due to heavy immigration of entrance status immigrants between 1900 and 1930, provided an excellent setting for the study of education and assimilation. The Lakehead's isolation and distance from central Ontario and limited financial and human resources of school boards, coupled with the rapid growth of the Lakehead's population with its particular socioeconomic and ethnic composition, shaped the development of provincial school education locally. These factors appeared to modify the original objectives stated by education officials to create a ""homogeneous citizenship"" through programs to achieve Anglo-conformity. The provincial school system was neither the only nor necessarily the most important influence on the assimilation process in the Lakehead between 1900 and 1939. Other agencies, which included religious, social, and political organizations sponsored by Canadians and immigrants of charter groups as well as entrance status immigrants, also played an important role in educating immigrants and shaping the assimilation process.

The British Commonwealth Labour Conferences (1925-1957), which brought together the labour parties from throughout the Commonwealth and attempted to create a unified labour movement, held out the reorganized British Labour Party as a model of success. The conferences are presented as important events in the shaping of Commonwealth labour’s political culture. The conferences seldom produced tangible results, but for the Commonwealth labourites they produced a sense of intangible solidarity and common purpose. In Canada, this cutcome was filtered through a particuiar set of national imperatives with the result that Canada’s path deviated from its sister Commonwealth nations.

Each organization gave up part of its operations in order to achieve this agreement. The Red Cross traded the right to run first aid courses in favour of exclusive rights to type, collect and distribute blood (and eventually blood products) in Canada. St. John Ambulance ceased to operate its blood grouping clinics in exchange for assurances that the Red Cross would stay out of the field of industrial first aid. The broker of this agreement was the Federal Government. Ottawa was concerned with introducing the Canadian population to the medical miracle of blood transfusion. It also wanted a rationalized first aid training system. Additionally, the Federal Government wanted to do both things with little cost and without stepping on provincial toes. The facilitating opportunity was provided by the Cold War and the needs of Civil Defence. In some measure, this intervention into a major health area can be seen as a happy accident.

It was promoted as a safe and effective means of alleviating mild to moderate anxiety, tension, and mental stress, and was originally intended for use in clinical practice to treat conditions of a medical nature. But, almost overnight, the consumption of meprobamate became quite fashionable, especially in the show business community and among the middle class. Demand for the drug increased, sales figures grew, and the conditions for which it was used expanded to include minor worries and everyday upsets. Significantly, women were twice as likely as men to receive a prescription for this new product. This thesis explores the meprobamate phencmenon as a case study in the process of medicalization. It asks two main questions: What does the introduction and widespread use of minor tranquilizing drugs in English-speaking Canada during the 1950s reveal about the medicalization of life in general and the medicalization of gender in particular? In what way can this investigation shed new light on the historical interpretation of Canada in the postwar period? Drawing on a wide range of written material, this thesis argues that any postwar analysis of the medicalization process needs to take into consideration the role of pharmaceutical companies. After the war, the drug industry grew dramatically and assumed more and more responsibility for informing and educating both doctors and the general public about the latest in drug therapy. It also arques that the fifties decade in Canada was a time of great paradox in that it was characterized by the desire for progress through medicine and medical science, and the desire for stability through the strict adherence to narrowly-defined gender roles. Meprobamate and other minor tranquilizing drugs promoted by pharmaceutical companies appealed to both the desire for progress and change and the search for stability and status quo. Together, these factors helped contribute to the medicalization of everyday life in general and the medicalization of gender in particular in English-speaking Canada after World War II.

It traces the development of her feminism, an indigenous prairie feminism rooted in the work of farm women, on small family farms of commodity producers, during the developmental stage of agriculture on the Canadian prairies. By finding “ground for common action' her particular kind of feminism, co-operative agrarian feminism, enabled her to play a leading role in the origins of the farm women’s movement in Canada. By 1918 she was the most influential farm woman in Canada. The thesis begins by looking at the impact of her life in radical North Kent, from 1879 to 1909. She came to Canada as a feminist supporter, with radical ideas about class and a knowledge of co-operatives. A Kentish country school teacher, she brought Edwardian enthusiasm and an open-minded attitude to her brother’s homestead in the Hillview farm district near Harris, Saskatchewan. Her experiences as a settler in Hillview and her 1911 operation turned her into a feminist activist and led her to begin developing an agrarian feminist ideology. She married John McNaughton, a homesteader from New Zealand and they formed a working partnership to organize the Hillview Grain Growers, one of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers’ Association (SGGA) locals that opposed the SGGA conservative leadership. Unlike their opponents, the McNaughtons linked a belief in government intervention in the economy with radical democratic ideas and they identified with the working class. They also linked the need for class equality with the need for gender equality and an end to war and militarism. McNaughton organized the Hillview Women Grain Growers in which she practised her agrarian feminist approach at a local level. McNaughton’s agrarian feminism developed as she organized the provincial Women Grain Growers (WGG), a new kind of farm women’s group. The WGG became the pattern for the women's sections of the United Farm Women in other provinces. These groups became a new stream in the farm women’s movement, along with the Homemakers and the Women’s Institutes. McNaughton’s feminism was rooted in her life as a farm woman and the belief that the work of farm women was necessary for the nation. Therefore they should have a say in the nation’s business and should be able to live well. McNaughton’s feminism matured as she and the WGG worked for numerous reforms and as they campaigned for women’s suffrage and for ""medical aid within the reach of all"" farm women and their families. This campaign eventually led to medicare. The final section of the thesis examines McNaughton’s inclusions and exclusions from the agrarian community .

Although based on the ideas of the NCJW of the United States, the NCTWC quickly became a distinctly Canadian institution whose focus was facilitating Jewish life in Canada. In fact, the NCJWC stands alone in the world of Jewish women’s organizations in its E concentration on Canadian concerns. The Council has enabled Jewish women to contribute to society in patriotic ways while preserving their Jewish identity, and has thus fostered the development of Judaism in Canada.

Métis policy, as well as Inuit policy, are not included in this study as these are separate policy fields, involving a different assemblage of policy actors. In terms of methodology, the thesis is organized around a heuristic device borrowed from political science - the “policy community” concept. It is argued that politicians, bureaucrats, church authorities, Native leaders, and interest group representatives formed an expanded Indian policy community after the Second World War. The composition, structure, and internal dynamics of this post-war Indian policy community were critical in determining the tone and content of government policy initiatives during the 1950s and into the early 1960s. The twenty years from 1943 to 1963 were a significant formative period for modern Indian policy. During these years Indian people and non-Indians went through a mutual “learning experience” that significantly altered the course of Indian-government relations. The period began with Indian administration in crisis: Indian socio-economic conditions were abysmal; government policy-makers were bankrupt of ideas and bereft of inspiration. Paternalism dominated government thinking and practices and the official policy of Indian assimilation aimed at destroying all vestiges of “Indianness”. The special joint committee of Parliament of 1946-48 recruited new policy actors to the post-war Indian policy community, breathed new life into Indian administration, and helped to recast Indian assimilation in more enlightened terms of Indian “integration” into Canadian society. While government officials consulted with Native leaders on aspects of the integration agenda, the peculiar structure of the post-war Indian policy community - its systemic stasis - maintained Indian people, their supporters, and interest groups on the periphery of political power and policy-making as “policy takers”. This study concludes that, while an expanded Indian policy community altered the context of post-war Indian policy deliberations, Indian Affairs officials controlled the policy process and brokered significant reforms acceptable to government’s agenda: Indian assimilation was recast in terms of Indian integration, paternalistic practices were gradually abandoned, an Indian political agenda was grudgingly acknowledged, and the notion of Indians as “citizens plus” was broached.

Bennett.,pdf,"Peacock, Kurt",1999,Master of Arts,https://curve.carleton.ca/2415aae6-da8f-487e-a6eb-7815b6635e36,"This study explores the intellectual foundations and abiding political ideas of Prime Minister R.B. Bennett prior to his launching of the 1935 ‘New Deal’. It seeks to associate Bennett's political philosophy with a dynamic strand of Canada’s conservative tradition — popularly referred to as ‘Red Toryism’ —and thus provide a more complete and somewhat revisionist understanding of the motivations behind the Bennett administration. In researching this paper at the National Archives of Canada, extensive use was made of microfilmed copies of the R.B. Bennett papers, as well as the papers of Robert Borden, Arthur Meighen, Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook) and the diaries of William Lyon Mackenzie King. A number of Royal Commission transcripts, newspapers, and Hansard debates have also been consulted. This study begins by examining a number of conservative views of the state prior to Bennett’s term in office. It then chronicles Bennett’s early political career and his views on the proper role of the federal state prior to his election as prime minister. The study then examines three specific initiatives launched by the Bennett government: the introduction of significant tariff increases, the establishment of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, and the formation of the Bank of Canada. These initiatives suggest that Prime Minister Bennett was not afraid to use the power of the state in the defense of the national collective, despite the limitations placed on state action by the global recession. This study concludes that long before the 1935 ‘New Deal’ broadcasts, Bennett was prepared to, and often did, use the power of the state to intervene in matters of national importance, and that his own views on state activity reflected a Red Tory tradition found within the Conservative party, and were as politically legitimate as a response to the Depression as the ideas of a number of his major political contemporaries. While a great number of Bennett’s political contemporaries have received more sympathetic treatment from Canadian historians, the evidence presented in this study seeks to present a more balanced case, and paint a far more complex political portrait of R.B. Bennett than earlier historical investigations have suggested.

This biography charts her intellectual development from her evangelical youth in Montreal and New York to her prominence as a religious speaker and writer with the Anglican Modernist movement in Oxford, England. It is an investigation into the gendered cultural context within which modern experiential faith has developed. Lily Dougall was known in Britain for her thought-provoking novels, such as Beggars All (1891), when she published, anonymously, the controversial lyrical religious essay, Pro Christo et Ecclesia (1900). Between 1900 and 1923 she wrote and edited a series of widely read works of modern theology, and became a popular modernist speaker, an advocate of spiritual healing through the Guild of Heaith, and a mentor to the Student Christian Movement and the Anglican Fellowship. With Canon B.H. Streeter, she created the Cumnor Group, an influential discussion group dedicated to liberal theology. As a religious modernist, Lily Dougall advocated free intellectual inquiry and rejected the traditional authorities of creed, doctrine and the Bible. She did not find miracles, even the miracles of the virein birth and phvsical resurrection of Christ, central to her faith. Instead her theology was experiential, based on the personal experience of God. The thesis identifies the origins of this liberal and experiential faith in the work of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Thomas Carlyle, F.D. Maurice, and American holiness theologian Thomas Upham, and describes the evolution of her religious thought through evangelicalism, the Anglican Broad Church, Christian socialism, personal idealism, modernism and Christian fellowship. The thesis argues for a more contextual and historically nuanced understanding of religious experience. It analyses the gendered nature of liberal spirituality, which shaped, and sometimes silenced, women’s theological expression, and discusses Dougall’s difficulties entering and working within the masculine world of theology. Finally, it examines the links between Edwardian experiential faith and the development of feminist theology, the modern study of mysticism, and the early science of psychology.

To do this, the evolution of the intelligence service is described, along with those significant events that shaped and spawned this transition. The intelligence service grew from an understaffed and under appreciated component of staff work into one comprising thousands of members. Almost from the moment the Canadians arrived at the front they began improving their intelligence system. But it was the batties of 1915: Second Ypres, Festubert and Givenchy — that pushed through the first major changes. Command confusion, ignorance, and loss of control marked Second Ypres and Festubert. On these occasions, the under trained Canadians met disciplined Germans, and paid a bloody price. At Givenchy the Canadians fared better thanks to more detailed planning. From these early experiences an enhanced appreciation for intelligence work emerged, along with an entirely new intelligence organization. From 1915, the Canadians became aggressive intelligence gatherers, collecting and analyzing every possible scrap of information before launching assaults. As tactics, technology and fire-power improved, so too did the intelligence organization, expanding to meet the altered circumstances. In doing so it enjoyed great success, compiling a tremendous amount of intelligence for commanders and planners. Operational plans became so detailed and complex that bartlefield confusion, luck, and chance were reduced, as prior calculation and mathematical precision helped commanders regain some control over events. Once operations opened up in 1918, the Canadian Corps adjusted its intelligence system to meet the changing tactical environment, and the need for increased tactical and command flexibility. The intelligence service, however, was able to adapt, and so continued to grease the wheels of command by providing an abundance of information to planners. This helped the corps come to grips with its surroundings, allowing it to maintain pressure on the enemy. While intelligence work was not the only reason for the corps” batllefield success, it was a principal element that cannot be ignored.

By the 1920s, evangelistic healing campaigns in large urban centres were drawing tens of thousands on a daily basis. This work traces the development of divine healing within Canadian Protestantism by examining a wide variety of groups that engaged in the practice, including the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the Salvation Army, the Christian Catholic Church, and Pentecostalism. It also analyzes the diverse reactions to divine healing on the part of fundamentalists, mainline Protestants, the medical community, and the state. By framing the phenomenon of divine healing as a history of the body, this dissertation presents a unique perspective on the multiple ways in which medical and religious discourses competed in their constructions of the body. Proponents of faith healing subverted the epistemological grounding of medical knowledge by turning insiead to the personal subjective experience of religion as the authoritative basis to lay claim to “divine health.” The social space in which faith healing took place was transformed over time, but the dominating presence of women remained a constant feature from the beginning. ‘This study explores the cultural practice of faith healing as both a devotional observance and a point of resistance to conventional medicine. It is argued that the act of healing took place within a matrix of religious and medical ideologies that were in turn enwrapped by constructions of gender, class, and social geography.

hist_189,The politics of British Commonwealth Air Training Plan base selection in Western Canada.,pdf,"Heide, Rachel Lea",2000,Master of Arts,https://curve.carleton.ca/56404d54-f84b-4753-b39d-54d3fe46866b,"Between 1940 and 1945, Canada made one of its largest contributions to the Allied war effort by training 131,533 Commonwealth pilots and air crew under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). Expanding the RCAF's aerodrome infrastructure to accommodate over one hundred training schools and their auxiliary fields was the most important task in making the BCATP a reality. Nevertheless, few historians have considered the site selection process. The two studies that mention this question in passing suggest that lobbying and voting Liberal gave communities a greater likelihood of being chosen. To verify these hypotheses, this thesis has consulted the RCAF and Department of Transport site investigation files, the minutes of Aerodrome Development Committee meetings, and the personal papers of the politicians involved in base selection. From these primary records - communities’ lobbying letters, investigation reports, and final selection decisions - this thesis has reconstructed the BCATP selection process and concluded that partisan politics played no part. Experts from the Department of Transport and the RCAF evaluated and selected sites according to pre-determined, objective, and technical criteria that ensured the timely and economical development of aerodromes suitable for military air training.

Bennett and chief Canadian diplomat to the United States, William Duncan Herridge was a force in Canadian politics from 1931 to 1935. Herridge and Bennett, by some accounts, met only in 1930, and it is remarkable that Herridge was able to gain the Conservative leader’s confidence in such a short time. This friendship grew as Herridge became more involved in Depression politics and diplomacy, and then married Bennett’s sister. While Minister to Washington, Herridge was preoccupied with three main issues: the St. Lawrence Deep Waterway Treaty, Reciprocity, and the New Deal. This thesis describes and examines these issues in detail from the standpoint of Herridge’s involvement, in an effort to assess the nature of his role and influence. At the heart of the enquiry is a paradox. Herridge is regarded in the literature as a spectacularly successful envoy and advisor. However, none of his three large objectives can be regarded in his own terms as a success.

The communal nature of the event provides an opportunity to consider prevailing attitudes towards authority among artisans in an urban setting. The study retrieves indicators of menralité among shoemakers and considers them in their social and cultural context. The argument is that the protest was intended as a proportionate response to perceived transgressions, on the part of authorities, of a mutually accepted code of privilege and precedence. The ceremonial procession served as a theatre of protest for artisans, who acted to sustain rather than to challenge the status quo. In a subsidiary thesis it is argued that ceremonial processions provide a useful tool for historians to access the mentalité and cultural values of groups within the menu peuple.

Popular hockey history has defined the era as one of great sacrifices by the National Hockey League, largely because academic research is non- existent. A closer examination reveals no great sacrifices in players or profit by NHL clubs. Most players who enlisted continued to play hockey on military teams, without seeing combat. This occurred with the tacit approval of the public, and with the help of the federal government’s flexible manpower policies. While this flexibility allowed players to escape combat, it was a side effect of an effort to appease pro- and anti- conscription factions. Morale-boosting was the catch-all justification for the continuation of professional and military hockey, as it tied overseas servicemen to home and reminded civilians of a better, peaceful time. More than that, it was an “acceptable” form of distraction, as it encouraged social cohesion and promoted nationalism.
